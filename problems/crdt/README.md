The `crdt` query and data come from Martin Kleppmann. The query describes update rules for a [conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) implementation of a shared text editor, described in the talk [Data structures as queries: Expressing CRDTs using Datalog](https://speakerdeck.com/ept/data-structures-as-queries-expressing-crdts-using-datalog?slide=22). The data are a sequence of edits Martin made while typing some associated text.

The input to the computation are only the points of insertions and deletions, but bogus writes are attached to each. The output `result` relation reflects the inserts and removes, but whose text content is not meaningful. Differential dataflow produces 104,851 facts, but this is not yet reproduced by other frameworks.
