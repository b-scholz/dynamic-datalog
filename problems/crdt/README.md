The `crdt` query and data come from Martin Kleppmann. The query describes update rules for a [conflict-free replicated data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) implementation of a shared text editor, described in the talk [Data structures as queries: Expressing CRDTs using Datalog](https://speakerdeck.com/ept/data-structures-as-queries-expressing-crdts-using-datalog?slide=22). The data are a sequence of edits Martin made while typing some associated text.
