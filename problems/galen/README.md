The `galen` query comes from John Liagouris, and the data from [the GALEN project](http://www.openclinical.org/prj_galen.html). The query comes from the paper [Efficient Identification of Implicit Facts in Incomplete OWL2-EL Knowledge Basesâˆ—](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p1993-liagouris.pdf), and describes an inferencing task in medical ontologies.

The correct results, by consensus, have 7,560,179 records in `p` and 16,595,494 records in `q`.

These are not large numbers of outputs, and yet the computation takes a fairly long time for the vanilla engines. This is (believed) due to relatively large amounts of intermediate work in producing the records, a result of suboptimal join evaluation.
